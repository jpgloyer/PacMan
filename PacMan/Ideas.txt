In corners mode, randomize target location for each ghost within the range of their corner once every 10 blocks (once every 2 seconds)
Only randomly generate one coordinate (in top left corner), then add half the width/height of the maze to make new random coordinates for the other ghosts

Give each ghost a constantly ticking timer to trigger certain actions (i.e. picking a new random target location, switching modes)


Set a character in the maze text file to be PacMan's spawn (and double as pickup location)

Fix the coordinate system
