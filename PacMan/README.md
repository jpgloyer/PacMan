# PacMan
My personally built, for educational purposes, in Python, knockoff PacMan game

This is a work in progress. 
If you're reading this, all you need to do to play the current version is download this folder, 
make sure Python is installed on your machine (python.org), and run "python.exe Main.py" in 
your favorite command line.

If you wish to run without a command line, you will have to slightly modify the code. It should be as simple as uncommenting lines 22 and 23 in Main.py, and shifting the below Main.py code to be within the second "with" statement.

If you're saavy with Python and feel like contributing commits/branches, feel free to help me out.

Detailed Steps To Run:
* Code(Big green button, top right) > Download ZIP
* Decompress ZIP folder (Remember the folder that stores the decompressed files; it would be smart to store it on the desktop)
* Go to python.org > Downloads Drop Down Menu > Download for your OS
* Follow Python's instructions for setting up Python on your machine
* Open a command line
    * For Windows the best option is Windows PowerShell. It is built into your computer. 
    * For Apple, the best option is Terminal. It should also be built in. 
* Navigate to the decompressed folder from step 2 using commands ('ls': lists available directories) and ('cd "directory_name"' to move to that directory)
    * User->Desktop->PacMan
* Run command 'python.exe Main.py'
* Have fun! Let me know about any game breaking bugs
