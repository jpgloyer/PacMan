# PacMan
My personally built, for educational purposes, in Python, knockoff PacMan game

This is a work in progress. 
If you're reading this, all you need to do to play the current version is download this folder, 
make sure Python is installed on your machine (python.org), and run "python.exe Main.py" in 
your favorite command line.

If you're saavy with Python and feel like contributing commits/branches, feel free to help me out.

Detailed Steps To Run:
1. Code > Download ZIP
2. Decompress ZIP folder
3. Go to python.org > Downloads Drop Down Menu > Download for your OS
3.5 (Python acts as a code interpreter. The code here can only be run on your machine with python.exe providing translation to lower level code. It is very trustworth reliable software and is an industry standard)
4. Follow Python's instructions for setting up Python on your machine
5. Open a command line 
5a. For Windows the best option is Windows PowerShell. It is built into your computer.
5b. For Apple, the best option is Terminal. It should also be built in.
