# PacMan
My personally built, for educational purposes, in Python, knockoff PacMan game

This is a work in progress. 
If you're reading this, all you need to do to play the current version is download this folder, 
make sure Python is installed on your machine (python.org), and run "python.exe Main.py" in 
your favorite command line.
